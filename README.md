# BatchNormalization
Batch normalization was introduced in Sergey Ioffe's and Christian Szegedy's 2015 paper Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift. The idea is that, instead of just normalizing the inputs to the network, we normalize the inputs to layers within the network. It's called "batch" normalization because during training, we normalize each layer's inputs by using the mean and variance of the values in the current mini-batch.
